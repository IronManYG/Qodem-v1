Use the app as a tester
------------
you can use these numbers to test the application

first test number = +966587654321
Verification code = 654321

second test number = +966 50 011 2233
Verification code = 112233

I added the second number to test the mechanism for removing the previous user's data after signing out and replacing it with the other user's data after signing in.
